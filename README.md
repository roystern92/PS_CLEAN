## Reflection

This was the first single page application I did for a customized client. This Project was focus on style more then complicate logic.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Bootstrap, ReactStrap, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, Cors, Multer, and a significant amount of CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
